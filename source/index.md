# Introduction

Welcome to the RMN-GP API! You can use our API to access RMN-GP API endpoints,
to retrieve information in the JSON format on various artworks, artists, and
related pictures in our database.

This documentation should help you discover our API, and includes some examples
using the Ruby programming language, on the right-most pane.
