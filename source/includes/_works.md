## Aggregations

The works endpoint can also decorate the response with some aggregation
computations. It works with the [aggregation framework from
Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/search-aggregations.html).

> For example, you can have some stats on the dimensions of the works painted
by Picasso:

```shell
curl -H "ApiKey: demo" \
     "http://api.dev.rmn.af83.com/v1/works?q=Picasso&aggregates[][name]=width&aggregates[][type]=stats&aggregates[][field]=width&aggregates[][name]=height&aggregates[][type]=stats&aggregates[][field]=height"
```

<pre class="live_requests" data-path="/v1/works?q=Picasso&aggregates[][name]=width&aggregates[][type]=stats&aggregates[][field]=width&aggregates[][name]=height&aggregates[][type]=stats&aggregates[][field]=height">
</pre>

Most fields are tokenized and stemmed for a better full-text search. It can
give weird results for aggregation. In that case, you can try to append `.raw`
to the field name.


> The birth place of the authors for the 19th century:

```shell
curl -H "ApiKey: demo" \
     "http://api.dev.rmn.af83.com/v1/works?aggregates[][name]=birth_place&aggregates[][type]=terms&aggregates[][field]=authors.birth_place.display.raw&facets[periods]=19e+siècle"
```

<pre class="live_requests" data-path="/v1/works?aggregates[][name]=birth_place&aggregates[][type]=terms&aggregates[][field]=authors.birth_place.display.raw&facets[periods]=19e+siècle">
</pre>

### Parameters

To add an aggregation, you have to give 3 parameters:

- `name`: it's the key in `aggregations` in the JSON response
- `type`: the type of aggregation to compute
- `field`: the field used as data to aggregate.

Type              | Description
----              |------------
min               | Returns the minimum value among the numeric values extracted from the aggregated documents
max               | Returns the maximum value among numeric values
sum               | Sums up numeric values
avg               | Computes the average of numeric values
stats             | Computes stats over numeric values (min, max, sum, avg and count)
extended_stats    | An extended version of the stats aggregation, where additional metrics are added such as `sum_of_squares`, `variance` and `std_deviation`
cardinality       | Calculates an approximate count of distinct values
value_count       | Counts the number of values that are extracted from the aggregated documents
missing           | Counts all documents in the current document set context that are missing a field value
percentiles       | Calculates percentiles over numeric values (1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 99%)
terms             | A multi-bucket value source based aggregation where buckets are dynamically built - one per unique value
significant_terms | Returns interesting or unusual occurrences of terms in a set (experimental!)
histogram         | Dynamically builds fixed size (a.k.a. interval) buckets over the values
date_histogram    | Same as histogram, but can use interval with not a fixed size (a month or a year for example)

For histograms, a fourth parameter, `interval`, will be given.

```shell
curl -H "ApiKey: demo" \
     "http://api.dev.rmn.af83.com/v1/works?aggregates[][name]=histogram&aggregates[][type]=date_histogram&aggregates[][field]=date.estimated_day&aggregates[][interval]=month"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

<pre class="live_requests" data-path="/v1/works?aggregates[][name]=histogram&aggregates[][type]=date_histogram&aggregates[][field]=date.estimated_day&aggregates[][interval]=month">
</pre>
